---
The **PlanEasy Crowdsourcing System** defines a unified and interoperable data structure  
for collecting, storing, and exporting responses from participatory questionnaires and mobility tracking.

This architecture is part of the broader **PlanEasy Framework**, developed to support  
scientific research, participatory mapping, and citizen science applications.  
It is **project-agnostic**, meaning that any initiative (e.g. [*theBIKEnet*](https://github.com/MovingProjects/thebikenet/blob/main/README.md)) can adopt this structure  
for consistent, transparent, and FAIR data management.

Responses can be stored, synchronized, or exported using the same schema  
across **Local**, **Firestore**, and **MongoDB** databases.

## 📋 Overview

The PlanEasy Crowdsourcing System supports multiple types of participant data collected through  
web and mobile questionnaires.

| **Dataset** | **Description** | **Collection / Example Path** | **Analysis Type** |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Survey Responses** | Statistical questionnaires about user profile, habits, perceptions, and attitudes. | `surveyResponses/{questionnaireId}/responses/{timestampId}` | Non-spatial (statistical) |
| **Spatial Reports** | Geo-located questionnaires describing infrastructure, parking, or safety issues. | `spatialReports/{questionnaireId}/responses/{timestampId}` | Spatial (GIS-based) |
| **Trips** | GPS traces and related pre- and post-trip surveys collected via the mobile app. | `trips/{tripId}/locations/{positionId}` | Spatiotemporal (behavioural) |

All datasets share the same principles:

- **Anonymity:** each record is pseudonymized using a SHA-256 hash of the participant’s email (`uid`).
- **Transparency:** all timestamps are stored in **UTC** and accompanied by the user’s **local timezone**.
- **FAIR compliance:** all questionnaire versions are version-controlled on GitHub for reproducibility and open research.

## 📋 Crowdsourced Data Schema

Each document represents one completed questionnaire or trip record.

- `answers`: responses matching the related questionnaire schema.  
- `geometry`: main spatial reference (usually a Point as centroid of reported locations); used for indexing and map display.  
- `bounding_box`: rectangular extent covering all related locations; used for spatial filters and zoom-to-fit.  
- `ttl_at`: date indicating when the record should be automatically deleted. In MongoDB it is stored as `ISODate("2030-10-08T10:12:00Z")` (used for TTL index),  
  while in Firestore it is stored as a `Timestamp`.

- `pre_trip`:  response (according to `response_schema`) for the questionnaire before the trip.
- `post_trip`: response (according to `response_schema`) for the questionnaire after the trip.
- `geometry`: main spatial reference (usually a Point as centroid of the trip path); used for indexing and map display.
- `bounding_box`: rectangular extent covering the entire trip; used for spatial filters and zoom-to-fit.
- `origin_geometry` and `destination_geometry`: points representing the start and end locations of the trip; both can be indexed and queried separately.
- `ttl_at`: date indicating when the record should be automatically deleted. In MongoDB it is stored as `ISODate("2030-10-08T10:12:00Z")` (used for TTL index),  
  while in Firestore it is stored as a `Timestamp`.

## 🧩 Storage Options

Each document follows the same schema across different storage environments.
This guarantees consistency between client-side storage, cloud synchronization, and long-term archiving.

---

🧱 Firestore Data Model

```
surveyResponses/{questionnaireId}/responses/{timestampId}
spatialReports/{questionnaireId}/responses/{timestampId}
trips/{tripId}/positions/{positionId} 
```
- Hierarchical model with subcollections (`responses`:  `positions`).
- `ttl_at` stored as ISO 8601 UTC timestamp.
- `creation_datetime` in UTC + `timezone` (e.g. `Europe/Rome`).  
- `positions` stored as time-ordered subcollection<>

---

🧱 MongoDB Data Model

---

```
survey_responses        // one document per statistical response
spatial_reports         // one document per geolocated report (GeoJSON)
trips                   // one document per trip (positions as array)
```
- Flat structure: no subcollections.
- `geometry` in GeoJSON format; 2dsphere index recommended.
- `ttl_at` stored as ISODate() and managed with a TTL index.  

---

🧱 Local Data Model (Offline Mirror)

---

```
surveyResponses/{questionnaireId}/responses/{timestampId}
spatialReports/{questionnaireId}/responses/{timestampId}
trips/{tripId}/locations/{positionId}
```
- Mirrors the Firestore model to simplify synchronization.
- Data stored temporarily before upload (IndexedDB or AsyncStorage).
- Uses identical schema to ensure compatibility with the cloud system.

## 🧩 Interoperability and FAIR Principles

The PlanEasy Crowdsourcing System is designed according to the **FAIR Data Principles**,  
ensuring that all research data are *Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,* and *Reusable*.

| Principle | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Findable** | Each dataset and questionnaire is identified by a unique `questionnaire_id` and version tag, allowing precise traceability across projects and time. |
| **Accessible** | All public documentation, schemas, and metadata are openly published and maintained under transparent licensing. |
| **Interoperable** | The unified JSON schema supports both NoSQL and document-based databases (Firestore, MongoDB), facilitating integration with analytical or GIS systems. |
| **Reusable** | Standardized metadata — such as `project`, `campaign`, and `timezone` — ensure reproducibility and enable long-term research use. |

## PlanEasy response v2

All new responses use one project-agnostic envelope:

```json
{
  "schema": "planeasy.response",
  "schema_version": "2.0",
  "response_kind": "survey | spatial_contribution | trip",
  "entity": {},
  "related_entities": [],
  "geometry": {},
  "answers": {},
  "meta": {"project": {}, "flow": {}, "user": {}, "device": {}}
}
```

`answers` remains nested and human-readable; canonical answer keys may use the `#` prefix. `entity` describes the primary object (for example a crossing or trip), while `related_entities` links contextual objects without inventing technical identifiers. `response_kind` is semantic and is independent from `db_set`, which is only a technical destination selector.

Responses are stored in these Firestore/local subcollections:

```text
surveyResponses/{questionnaireId}/responses/{responseId}
spatialReports/{questionnaireId}/responses/{responseId}
trips/{questionnaireId}/responses/{responseId}
```

Optional email input is transformed to SHA-256 before persistence; raw email must never be saved or logged. Aggregate/CTLUp exports may remove both `uid` and `meta.user.user_id`. A pre-hashed Movesion identifier is treated as an identifier and is never interpreted as an email.

The loader/normalizer may temporarily accept response v1 and map its flat fields into this envelope. New questionnaire definitions and new responses must not contain a `legacy` block. Questionnaires define collection instruments; the framework defines the contract; `db_set` and the destination configuration define where data is written.
